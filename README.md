# Mani

<img src="./res/logo.svg" align="right"/>

`mani` is a CLI tool that helps you manage multiple repositories. It's useful when you are working with microservices, multi-project systems, many libraries or just a bunch of repositories and want a central place for pulling all repositories and running commands over them.

You specify repository and commands in a config file and then run the commands over all or a subset of the repositories.

* Binaries are available on the [release](https://github.com/alajmo/mani/releases) page

* via cURL (Linux & macOS)
  ```sh

  ```

* via Homebrew

  brew install mani
  ```

### Building From Source

1. Clone the repo
2. Build and run the executable
    ```sh
    make build && ./dist/mani
    ```

## Usage

### Create a New Mani Repository

Run the following command inside a directory containing your `git` repositories:

```sh
$ mani init
```

This will generate two files:

- `mani.yaml`: contains projects and custom tasks. Any sub-directory that has a `.git` inside it will be included (add the flag `--auto-discovery=false` to turn off this feature)
- `.gitignore`: includes the projects specified in `mani.yaml` file

It can be helpful to initialize the `mani` repository as a git repository so that anyone can easily download the `mani` repository and run `mani sync` to clone all repositories and get the same project setup as you.

### Common Commands

```sh
# Run arbitrary command (list all files for instance)
mani exec --all 'ls -alh'

# List all repositories
mani list projects

# List repositories in a tree-like format
mani tree projects

# Describe available tasks
mani describe tasks

# Run task for projects that have the frontend tag
mani run list-files --tags frontend

# Run task for projects under a specific directory
mani run list-files --paths work

# Run task for specific project
mani run list-files --project project-a

# Open up mani.yaml in your preferred editor
mani edit
```
