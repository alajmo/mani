# Introduction

`mani` is a CLI tool that helps you manage multiple repositories. It's useful when you are working with microservices, multi-project systems, many libraries or just a bunch of repositories and want a central place for pulling all repositories and running commands over them.

You specify repository and commands in a config file and then run the commands over all or a subset of the repositories.

## Features

- Clone multiple repositories in one command
- Run custom or ad-hoc commands over multiple repositories
- Flexible filtering
- Declarative configuration
- Portable, no dependencies
- Supports auto-completion
