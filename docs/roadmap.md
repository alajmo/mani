# Roadmap

`mani` is under active development. Before **v1.0.0**, I want to finish the following tasks:

- [ ] Bring changes from `sake`
  - Refactor import logic and support recursive nesting of tasks
  - Add new table format output (tasks in 1st column, output in 2nd, one table per project)
- [ ] Allow user to edit mani config from command line or TUI
